# Tools used
- Numpy, pandas for data analysis
- Statsmodels for data modelling
- Geopandas and matplotlib for graphing

# What did I learn?

- Handling geospatial biological data at scale
- Combining statistical modeling with geodata
- Using DBSCAN and clustering logic to extract temporal associations
- Managing messy real-world data (invalid localities, OCR parsing issues, etc)
