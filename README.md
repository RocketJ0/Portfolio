# 👋 Hi, I'm Joel

Welcome to my project portfolio. Here you'll find a collection of my work in data analysis, computer vision, and more.

## Projects

### [🌡️Temperature humidity regression](./1.Temp,-humidity)
An investigation into how temperature and humidity are connected, with an attempt to form a model of linear regression between them, from a picture showing humidity data to a picture of temperature data.

### [🏥Framingham Heart Study](./2.Fram-regression)
Tries to establish correlations between different factors of the Framingham Heart study, to investigate how factors affect Systolic Blood Pressure and to calculate the probability of having high blood pressure. 

### [K means for cloud cover](./3.Cloud-cover-K-means)
Applies the K means algorithm to isolate clouds over maps.

### [DNA sequence analysis: Markov Chains](./4.DNA-sequence-analysis)
An investigation into biological sequences and markov chains.

### [Syllabuss: Database extraction from images](./5. Syllabuss)
Creates a database of university courses taken by students using screenshots of a webpage.

### [Fossil Analysis](./6.Fossil-Analysis)
Analyses fossil distribution to study patterns of speciation over time and space.

...and more to come!
