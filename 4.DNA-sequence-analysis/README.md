# Sequence Analysis in Python
A series of exercises exploring DNA/RNA sequence processing, probabilistic models, and hash-based data structures, inspired by computational biology tasks.

## What did I learn?
- Hashing and dictionaries can be powerful tools in many contexts. I used them in ways I would not have otherwise, thanks to this project.
- The structure of Markov chains, and how they model probabilistic sequences.
